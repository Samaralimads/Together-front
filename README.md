# Together

An iOS app that helps couples find and plan activities to do together: browsing and filtering
activities, proposing dates (accept / decline / reschedule), pairing with a partner via an invitation
code, and a shared profile with couple statistics.

This repo contains only the iOS client. The backend API lives in the **Together-back** repo
(Vapor + MySQL).

## Tech stack

- **SwiftUI**, Swift 5, **MVVM** architecture
- `@Observable` for ViewModels (no Combine)
- **EventKit** for adding activities to the device calendar
- No external dependencies (no SPM packages, no CocoaPods) — everything is built with Apple
  frameworks

## Architecture

Each feature under `Features/` follows the same split:

```
Feature/
├── Model/         Codable structs representing the API data
├── View Model/    @Observable class: screen state + calls into Services
└── View/          declarative SwiftUI views, no business logic
```

A root-level `Services/` layer encapsulates networking (`APIClient`, then one service per resource:
`ProfileService`, `PlannedActivityService`, `ActivityService`, `CoupleService`, …) — ViewModels never
know the URL or JSON shape of a request.

```

## Requirements

- Xcode matching the SDK configured in the project (current `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`: 26.2)
- The **Together-back** backend must be running (locally or reachable) for the app to work

## Configuration

The API base URL is hardcoded in `Together/Services/APIClient.swift`:

```swift
private let baseURL = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
```

- Simulator + a local backend (`swift run` in Together-back): no change needed.
- Physical device: replace `127.0.0.1` with the local network IP of the machine running the backend
  (same Wi-Fi network).

### Permissions (Info.plist)

- `NSCalendarsFullAccessUsageDescription` — needed to add a date to the calendar
- `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` — needed to pick a profile photo

## Running the project

1. Start the backend (`Together-back`: `swift run`)
2. Open `Together.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Run on a simulator (or a device, after adjusting `baseURL`)

## Main features

- Sign up / sign in (email + password), forgot password
- Onboarding: birth date, relationship start date, optional partner pairing
- Pairing with a partner via an invitation code
- Activity discovery with search and filters (theme, budget, duration, indoor/outdoor)
- Proposing an activity together, with accept / decline / reschedule
- Adding to the device calendar, reminders
- Favorites and activity history ("My Dates")
- Profile: relationship counter, important dates, couple statistics, settings
